# Julia Weinstein
### Hi everyone! My name is Julia and I'm originally from Westfield, New Jersey. I'm currently entering my junior year at Lehigh and studying Psychology with a minor Data Science. I'm excited to learn more about the power of data through this course.
### My involvement on campus consists of being a member of the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority chapter, the club soccer team, and the executive board for a new club called CompSci in Bethlehem. This summer, besides taking this courses, I will be working as a part-time research assistant in Dr. Jessecae Marsh's lab on campus. I will also be working a summer soccer camp and also just spend time recuperating for the upcoming 2023 fall semester.
